Risk Management Excellence - NIST 800-37 Framework Training, by packt Publishing

Elevate your cybersecurity expertise with the NIST 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) course. Explore essential components of RMF, risk assessment methodologies, implement security control, and integrate compliance frameworks. 

This short course on the NIST 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) is tailored for cybersecurity professionals seeking to elevate their risk management skills. Delve into the core principles and components of the NIST 800-37 RMF, gain expertise in risk assessment methodologies, security control selection, implementation, and assessment. 

The NIST 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a set of guidelines and best practices developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to assist organizations in managing and mitigating information security risks effectively. It provides a structured approach to risk management, emphasizing continuous monitoring and a lifecycle process for securing information systems. 

The NIST 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) guides organizations through a systematic risk management process. It begins with “Prepare” to establish context and allocate resources, followed by “Categorize” for classifying information systems. The subsequent steps include “Select Controls” to tailor security measures, “Implement Controls” to put them into practice, “Assess Controls” for effectiveness evaluation, “Authorize” for system approvals, and “Monitor” for continuous oversight and response to changes in the information system’s environment. 

Upon completion, you will possess a clear understanding of the framework principles and components. Armed with this knowledge, navigate the risk management lifecycle with confidence. You will gain proficiency in identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks, selecting and implementing security controls, and ensuring continuous monitoring and authorization aligned with industry best practices.
